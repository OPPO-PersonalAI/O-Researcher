Its very rare and therefore must have a really interesting reason behind this adaptation!\nEspecially as this horizontal gene transfer has been well -studied in microbial systems, but not in plants and animals (this is a relatively new discovery).  Understanding  how commonly genes move between eukaryotic species and whether these transfers confer benefits would be really interesting to find out"}
